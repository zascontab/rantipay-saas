A background job, also known as a background task or asynchronous task, refers to a process or piece of work that is executed independently and concurrently with the main execution flow of a software application or system. 
You can use background job to do tasks like sending emails, long-run data analysis.

The implementation of background job is based on [asynq](https://github.com/hibiken/asynq)

## Server

[`job.Server`](https://github.com/go-saas/kit/blob/main/pkg/job/server.go) implements kratos `transport.Server` 
You can apply middleware pattern to `job.Server`

```go
import (
	klog "github.com/go-kratos/kratos/v2/log"
	"github.com/go-saas/kit/pkg/job"
	"github.com/go-saas/kit/user/private/biz"
	"github.com/hibiken/asynq"
)

func NewJobServer(opt asynq.RedisConnOpt, log klog.Logger, handlers []*job.Handler) *job.Server {
    // set queue
	srv := job.NewServer(opt, job.WithQueues(map[string]int{
		string(biz.ConnName): 1,
	}))
	srv.Use(job.TracingServer(), job.Logging(log))
	job.RegisterHandlers(srv, handlers...)
	return srv
}

```

## UI

The default ui is exposed in [sys module](../../modules/sys)
