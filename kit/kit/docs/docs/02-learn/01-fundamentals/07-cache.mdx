In a web system, a cache refers to a mechanism that stores and manages copies of frequently accessed data, resources, or web content in a temporary storage location. The primary purpose of a cache is to improve the performance and responsiveness of a web application or website by reducing the need to fetch data or resources from their original, slower sources. Caching is a fundamental technique used to speed up web systems and optimize resource utilization.

Cache is based on [gocache](https://github.com/eko/gocache) and data format is defined as [Protobuf](./protobuf)

## Cache Consistency

- Event-Driven Invalidation:
    Cache invalidation events are generated whenever relevant data changes(after [local transactions](./data-access/local-transaction)). Subscribers listen to these events and invalidate or update their caches accordingly. This approach ensures that caches stay in sync with data changes.
