ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping. It is a programming technique and a software design pattern used in software development to bridge the gap between object-oriented programming languages and relational database systems. The primary goal of ORM is to simplify and streamline the process of working with databases in object-oriented code.

ORM allows us to implement row-level SaaS data isolation more quickly and securely, and the underlying [go-saas/saas](https://github.com/go-saas/saas) project supports both [ent](https://entgo.io/) and [gorm](https://gorm.io/index.html).
